### Hello there stranger ðŸ‘‹ my name is Luis Castaneda

I'm a Jr. Java and Python Developer. My journey into the world of software development began about 1 and a half years ago, and I'm proud to be a non-traditional learner. Unlike others, I didn't pursue a four-year university to learn how to code. I found my passion in technology when I was recovering from an accident and I got really curious about the inner workings of the terminal. With the completion of Google's IT Support Specialist Program, I learned all the tech basics. During this asynchronous program, I was introduced to the power of Bash scripting, and that experience sparked more curiosity about programming. Soon, I found myself diving headfirst into my first general-purpose programming language: Python. In this Python, journey through two amazing courses on Coursera. The first course, "Python for automation", was taught by experts from Google. The second, "Python for Data Science, AI & Development," was an eye-opening experience guided by instructors from IBM. Although the concepts were challenging to grasp, I kept going and successfully completed these courses. Fast-forward a few more months later, and I decided to expand my skills by enrolling in the Java Development Program offered by Merit America. This intensive 6-month course provided me with a deeper understanding of software development, by the end of it, everything became much clearer, and all of a sudden all the hard-to-understand concepts made sense. My journey in the world of technology and software development has been rewarding, fun, and dynamic, and I'm excited to continue growing & learning in this ever-evolving field. My goal is to become a DevOps Engineer if possible even more!
